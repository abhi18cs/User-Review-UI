Project-2 "User Review UI"



Today I completed developing a project named "Responsive Webpage" which is a single-page website in HTML & CSS.

I have set a target to do at least 10 projects in 30 days. (24/03/2023)





What have I learnt from this project ?



1.) How can I make the moving image?



2.) The second thing is the CSS transitions and translations, I seriously didn't know that CSS has such great options.



3.) How to use Swiperjs file in your program





How this project has helped me ?



Earlier I directly used to jump right in the development phase of the project without even knowing the 'what' and 'how' of it. It gave me the essence to think all the way from beginning i.e. from the idea to the final outcome.



Shortcomings I faced while working on it.



1.) The responsive part of this website was a bit challenging for me as I find it difficult to calculate the exact pixel where the media query needed to be implemented. Finding the pixel and then converting it to 'em', that's where I struggled





3.) We have all heard of "Imposter Syndrome", I have faced it all through, sometimes I felt that why am I doing this course, I'm lacking in a lot of things, I'm at the beginning stage and everyone is ahead of me. This I'm sure has happened to everyone once in their learning stages.



Glad, I could get past all of this and build my project!üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è



Anyways looking excitingly forward to building more such amazing projects.
